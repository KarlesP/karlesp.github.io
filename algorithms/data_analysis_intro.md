title: Intro to Data Analysis
---

## Introduction
Studying programming languages and their advantages is one thing, knowing the applications and materializing an idea is another. Here I will present the applications of programming in Data analysis.

## Methods of Analysis
I am going to be straight here, analyzing the data is not hard, there are hundreds of books that you can read on Data analysis, the difficult part is to explain the results of the analysis that you just applied. 

Here I will be talking about Quantitative Analysis and not Qualitative Analysis (the main diffrence is that quantitative uses...quantities, like height-wight and qualitative uses everything else, like interviews and essays). 

Now, Qualitative Methods, Data Analysis, have deep roots in Statistics and most of those roots are coming out of Descriptive Statistics, meaning that Data Analysis uses a lot of Descriptive analysis like plots, means and standard deviations. That way the analyst can present the data and his results without having to explain every step.


## Programming Languages
If you want to start Data Analysis I would suggest R or Python which are amazing when they come to Data Science and Data Analysis. 

## Epilogue
Ok, yes I didn't go in depth in this page BUT I did it because in this site you will find scripts that actually do data analysis. But if you want to study I would suggest papers from Social Sciences, mainly to see how demographics are being made and books like "Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython" by Wes McKinney and J H Maindonald's "Using R for Data Analysis and Graphics Introduction, Code and Commentary" which you can finde [HERE for free](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/usingR.pdf)

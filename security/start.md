## Prologue
Before I say anything bare in mind that I am no expert, sometime I use Pentesting techniques with my projects so I can maintain a connection or scan for exploits. That being said here you will find a few resources to get you started on this long journey.

## First things first
If you start studying pentesting remember that you will need to know a language because most of the time you will need to read someone else's code, for example a site might be written in PHP so you have to know PHP to understand where to look.

Suggested Languages: Python, PHP, Perl, SQL

## Networking
After you learn a programming language you will need to learn about networking, [**here**](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/collateral/Syllabus_PTSV3.pdf) you can find a free book on that subject.

## Hands on 
If you made it through all that it is time to get down to it with a few online challenges like [Over The Wire's Wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)

Now it is time to get your hands dirty with an OS like [Kali's VM](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-hyperv-image-download/) or if you want to you can boot it with a [Kali Live image](https://www.kali.org/downloads/). 

The reason I encourage the use of Kali it's because you can learn so much using a Linux terminal but even if you don't know Kali has a vast toolset with so many applications.

## Keeping up with the community
Because Pentesting has so many applications with so many orginazations and people to practice it you will need to keep up with everything so following teams on social media like Hak5 or conventions like Defcon is a must.

## Prologue
Hi! If you are new here you will be glad to know that this site, yes this one, is a place where **you** can learn diffrent programming languages with a few easy steps, depending on the language, but **BE WARNED** this is not an _ordinary site_ where we are explaining in depth the DOs and DONTs of every single language and we don't use so much terminology (explanations are more practical and terminology will be used only if it is absolutley necessary).

One thing tha you will need to know is that I have taken two classes in programming but **I am not a developer according to my degree**. I have been studying Software Development and Programming since 2012 and I am shareing what I have gathered with you in Object-Oriented Languages (like C++ and C), Query Languages (SQL), Scientific lnguages (like Fortran and R) and many more!!!

### Before we start
First I would like you to let you know you a couple of things beforehand just [click here](intro_programming)

### Introductories and Programming
Here you will find introductions to diffrent Computer Science concepts like Algorithms, Big Data, Data Analysis and Lambda Calculus which are both for beginners and advanced developers.

| Title                                  | Description                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| [Algorithms](algorithms/algor)| A Quick recap of the fundementals                                                   |
| [Data analysis](algorithms/data_analysis_intro)| Presenting what Data analysis is as well as a quick intro to start reading. |
| [Big Data](algorithms/big_data_intro) | A quick introduction to Big data                                                    |
| [Lambda Calculus](algorithms/lambda)|A really easy Lambda calculus intro |


#### Programming Languages
For programming languages I noted some practical examples and mention some pros and cons as well two reading materials that I found useful. So it's basically **how to write** in that language and *where you can use it*

| Title |Description|
| :-----|:----------:|
|[Intro to Java](languages/java_intro)|A quick intro to Java |
|[Intro to R](languages/r_intro)| A quick intro to R|
|[Intro to C++](languages/c_plusplus_intro)|A quick intro to C++ |
|[Intro to Python](languages/python_intro)|A quick intro to Python 3|

### Web development
In the Web development section I mention how to get started and a few resources, but for them to work you will need a software, such as WAMP whare you can run your applications.

|[PHP](web/php_intro)|A quick intro to PHP|

#### Pentesting
First-up the following tutorials are for **educational purposes**, what you do with that knowledge that's on you. Now, for pentesting I would suggest to use a VM like Virtual Box from Apache or VM-ware OR of you know how to dual boot I would suggest to use a bootable USB with Kali Linux or Black Arch. Also everything that I show you here should be treated with respect, no matter in what you category of "hat" you think you are (black, grey, white, red) you should respect the art of security testing and puzzle solving.

### Applications
#### Proojects with I/O
Projects using I/O (such as Internet of Things) are useful and creative, so if you want to start your very own Patenda I suggest you start here.

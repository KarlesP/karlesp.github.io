So, you want to learn Malbolge. Ok, but before we continue I would like to say you that Malbolge is also a one of the circles of
hell from the book "Dante's Inferno". Now that is cool right? Well... that is the only cool thing about Malbolge. Quick 
fact; Malbolge was created by a computer and thus the language is a low-esoteric language. To write "Hello World" alone is a headache. 
But here I will **TRY** to explain as much as I can because it's a really difficult language to learn without a  background as 
a mathematician or a developer.

So let's begin; to write malbolge you will need an implementation or a virtual machine. To find a Malbolge implementation you can use
your favourite search engine or go to [this website](http://www.malbolge.doleczek.pl/)

Now let's write "Hello World" just for fun and laughs.

Hello World:

```
(=<`$9]7<5YXz7wT.3,+O/o'K%$H"'~D|#z@b=`{^Lx8%$Xmrkpohm-kNi;gsedcba`_^]
\[ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA@?>=<;:9876543s+O<oLm
```

Did you get any of that? Great! Now let's run the CAT program (which prints out every keystroke)!

```
(aBA@?>=<;:9876543210/.-,JH)('&%$#"!~}|{zy\J6utsrq
ponmlkjihgJ%dcba`_^]\[ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGF('C%$$^

[ZYXWVUTSRo
```

Now that you understand ALL of that code (which is SOOO easy to understand) let's move on to the Actual part 
which is...you can't write Malbolge.Well, you can but as I said you need a interperter or another language, you can 
also use HELL and go from there but Malbolge has no actual applications in the real world, though on the other hand the 
mathematics of Malbolge are amazing and if you like cryptography you are going to love them.

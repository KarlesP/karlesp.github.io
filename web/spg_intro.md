title: Web Development using Static Page Generators
---
## Introduction
A static site generator (SSG) is a compromise between using a hand-coded static site and a full CMS. You generate an HTML-only website using raw data (such as Markdown files) and templates. The resulting build is transferred to your live server.

The reason you might want to build a static is because there is no communication with the server and thus it is safer.

Now that I explained what is a SSG here are a few sites that you can copy, change and use for your benefit:

## Examples

| Site  | SSG      | Language  |

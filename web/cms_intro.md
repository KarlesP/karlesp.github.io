## Introduction
A content management system (CMS) stores page content in a database and provides facilities to edit and apply themes. Management becomes easier at the expense of flexibility, performance, server requirements, security and backups.

The great thing about CMS is that there are communities that create templates, tools and modules that you can use for your website and that way you'll need to code less.

Below you'll find some sites that are built with CMS tools:

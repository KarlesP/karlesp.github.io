## About Web Development
The internet is a great place, right? You have a question or you are looking for something to buy and the first thing that comes to mind is to look for it online. For this to happen someone has to create a website or a web-application (web-app) for the thing that you are looking. Here I will showcase what I have learned from web development, also known as _"how to create a website or a web-apps"_.

Before we continue you will need to understand 2 concepts: _Frontend development_ and _Backend development_. That means that I will explain in the simplest way possible, present tables with some examples from Github and what tools and languages you can use to develop your own web-app or website.

### Frontend
Front-End is everything a user sees like the User Interface (UI), every graphic and color on the screen, every animation that you see and every button yoy interact with.

#### Examples

| Language        | Example Applications (that you can find on Github)  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| SCSS      | [Spin That sh*t](https://matejkustec.github.io/SpinThatShit/)  | 
|Sass      | [Sassline](https://sassline.com/)      |
| CSS | [Brand colors](http://brand-colors.com)      |
|Javascript| [Dynamic animations](http://dynamicsjs.com/) |

### Back-End
When we are talking about functions, querries and everything "communications" from the side of the server we are talking about Backend development, everything that happens in the background

#### Examples
| Language        | Example Applications from Github  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| C#.Net      | [MultiSafepay](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/.Net)  | 
| Perl      | [Simple Login](https://github.com/bobtfish/catalystx-simplelogin)      |
| Python | [Django Axes](https://github.com/jazzband/django-axes/)      |
|Node JS (Javascript)| [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) |

### Tools
Because you need a website for your web-app to work (meaning a server to host your app and an web adress for someone to access it) you'll need to know that the needs to create a website have evolved from the early 2000's and we don't just use HTML and CSS (which were the first two languages you'll need to learn to create a website), instead we use site generators and templates and CMS because we finish with our product faster and then we can create every animation, login page etc.

#### CMS
Also known as Content Management Systems, CMS is the first thing that comes to mind when we are talking about a simple website, the downside here is the security because most CMS tools like Wordpress create generic websites and because of that every logical and coding error is being copied to new sites which means that the Web Developer needs to scan and secure vulnerabilities like a pentester or use tools and code to cover those mistakes. 

Usually they are used for e-commerce, blogs or complete websites that support web-apps.

Known CMS: Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla

#### Static Site Generator
Static site generators are usually groups programs, in different languages, that create static websites, that means that they don't use methods like login, it is one website for evveryone (like the one you are in right now). Like CMS, site generators have similar ups and downs, but here you can create a script that covers every page you create so you don't have to cover every vulnerability for every page you make, you only have to do it once and then do cover the vulnerabilities from your web-apps.

Known Static Site Generators: Jekyll, Hexo, Octopress

#### Programming Languages (frameworks)
Last but not least is to create a website from scratch using any language you desire. It might be more time consuming but that way you can understand the ins-and-outs of your website or web-app.

Known frameworks: Django (Python), Flask(Python), Ruby on rails(Ruby), Angular(Javascript), Node(Javascript), Yii(PHP)
